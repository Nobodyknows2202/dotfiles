# Joe's Dotfiles
### Install
Use the install.sh file to install. Caution: Will destroy current dotfiles from the included programs list.

### Current Dotfiles
These are the current programs supported by my dotfiles:
* NeoVim
* i3 (Window Manager)
* zsh and oh-my-zsh

### Updating Dotfiles
In order to update the dotfiles, edit the files in the git-managed folders. The 'files' in the .config folder are, in fact, Symlinks to the git-managed files.
